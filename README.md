# Flutter Clap Contest App

Clap Contest is an exciting and interactive Flutter app that turns applause into a fun competition! Using your device's microphone, it measures the noise generated by claps and crowns a winner based on the highest score.

## Features

- Real-time clap detection and noise measurement using Flutter's audio plugins
- Score calculation based on clap intensity and duration
- Fun and engaging user interface with audio-visual feedback using Flutter animations

## How It Works

1. Players gather around the device running the Flutter app.
2. The app starts listening for claps when the game begins.
3. Players take turns clapping as loudly as they can.
4. The app measures the noise level and duration of each clap.
5. Scores are calculated and displayed in real-time.
6. When the time is up, the player with the highest score wins!
